Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines - given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

# 3.3.2 (2021-03-23)

__Bug Fixes:__
* Fixed IE11 support for components that previously used [Function.name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name) to resolve component names.


# 3.3.1 (2019-10-10)

__Bug Fixes:__
* Multiple React components: Fixed `fetch` compatibility issues with Edge < 18


# 3.3.0 (2019-05-14)

__New Features__
* Add new React components for common ORIS application features (Emulate, AppLoader, AppError, Lookup, Modal, Profile, Navbar, SystemAlert, ShibbolethMonitor)
* Add `i.required-asterisk` component style to render out the red asterisk used on required fields in any context that a designer wants (e.g. for individual checkbox labels or a form heading)

__Bug Fixes:__
* Lookup: Fix component not updating `$.Lookup` when `value, valueKey` props mutate
* DataTables: Fix _empty container class always inheriting underlying `.even, .odd` styles
* Fix extra margins added for adjacent inputs in a group

__UI Changes:__
* DataTables: Swapped what row is "darkened" for a `.stripe` table to improve the look of paginated tables with an even number of records per page
* Added Capita as an available font - with Times New Roman fallback
* Change `h1, h2` headings to scarlet Capita
* Add a slight additional margin between navbar links to reduce crowding
* Slightly adjust the grey of `.navbar` tabs to better support embedding into modals


# 3.2.1 (2018-03-13)

__Bug Fixes:__
* Emulate: Fixed incorrect property call to Lookup


# 3.2.0 (2018-03-13)

__New Features:__
* Uploader: Added user confirmation prior to sending a request to delete a file
* Uploader: Added `dataField` option (default: `filedata`) to support changing the target for `$_FILES`
* Uploader: Added the ability to specify per-file metadata (submitted to delete/download endpoints as `file-metadata`)

__Bug Fixes:__
* Removed specificity for `form-group.is-required` label star suffixes - fails for cases where labels are inside a BS4 rowset
* Fixed `.form-group` margins for the case when the `.form-group` is combined with a `.col-*` class (margins failed to collapse due to additional padding)
* Fixed edge case of incorrect margins for a `.form-group` that is defined as a `fieldset` (fieldsets do *not* allow margin collapse)
* Update gulp-sass dependency to `^3` due to 404 errors being thrown for the old `^2` branch's dependencies
* Component: Fixed a missing ifelse causing all function calls to be treated as property getters
* Uploader: Fixed static method call for item template DOM
* Uploader: Improved error handling and error states
* Uploader: Moved request body payload to query parameters for DELETE requests to support certain webservers ignoring the body of a DELETE request
* Uploader: Fixed event listeners handling events in the same call stack as the Uploader plugin
* Uploader: Fixed various edge cases causing `isEmpty` to incorrectly return false

__UI Changes:__
* Rounded badges to make them look less like buttons
* Changed DataTables pagination controls to look/behave like Bootstrap 4
* Removed some redundant (noisy) borders from tables/DataTables
* Defaulting DataTables to a non-paging simple table-only view. Additional features are to be turned on at developerâ€™s discretion
* Uploader: Changed default file info to `Complete` for previously uploaded files without a custom `info` field

__Internal Changes:__
* Uploader: Defaulting `download` option to false
* Uploader: Cleaned up SASS


# 3.1.1 (2018-02-13)

__Bug Fixes__:
* Lookup: Fixed support for array notation in lookup input names. `name="foo[arr]"` will require a sibling input with `name="foo-key[arr]"`
* Lookup: Fixed incorrect variable reference for `keyValue` method


# 3.1.0 (2018-02-07)

__Backwards Breaking Changes:__
* Lookup: Changed `store` option to `key` to better reflect its purpose
* Lookup: Will no longer move the `name` attribute from the Lookup input to the hidden "key" input. This changes how data is POSTed alongside forms, as you will no longer get the hidden key value but instead the original display text of the input for the named field. Key value will now be stored and submitted via an input named the same as the original lookup input, but with the suffix `-key`.

__Bug Fixes:__
* Fixed Lookup incorrectly forcing focus to the input when `set()` or `clear()` methods are called via Javascript
* Fixed Lookup not automatically setting itself to <code>readonly</code> if prepopulated with a value
* Fixed margins for checks/radios inside a `.form-check-inline` group

__Implemented Enhancements:__
* Lookup: Now supports using a pre-populated "key" input on initial DOM load. The input MUST be a sibling to the lookup input and named the same plus the suffix `-key`. E.g. for `<input data-provide="lookup" name="foo" ...>` there would be an `<input name="foo-key" ...>` sibling. If one could not be found, a hidden input will be created automatically that meets the requirements.
* Added kebabcase synonym for all frontend components registered in the jQuery prototype. E.g. `$.fn.CoolTool` is also now registered as `$.fn['cool-tool']`
* Added rule to throw an error if a component name overrides an existing entry in jQuery's prototype


# 3.0.1 (2018-02-01)
There's Always Something Edition

__Bug Fixes:__
* Fixed class names for Emulate component DOM template (changed for BS4 Release)
* Fixed checkboxes for Feedback component DOM template (changed for BS4 Release)
* Fixed Lookup setting a `display: block` on the clear button - causing adjacent buttons to be misaligned


## 3.0.0 (2018-01-23)
Upgrade to Bootstrap 4.0.0 Release and to ES6 for Javascript components

This upgrade requires changes to the `gulpfile.js` in ES5 applications (any application doing an upgrade from oris/ui 2.0 to 3.0),
changes to the version of Bootstrap included from Assets, and contains a number of backwards breaking changes
between Bootstrap 4 Beta 2 and Release.

* Upgrade to Bootstrap 4.0.0 Release
* Rewrite of Javascript components to ES6

* Fixed responsive navbar rules for when a `form-inline` is adjacent to a `profile`
* Fixed alignment of icons for inputs included in a navbar's `form-inline`

* Fixed cursor to be a pointer for default button styles
* Fixed z-indexes for custom components going higher than Bootstrap components (e.g. navbar being rendered over modals)

__Implemented Enhancements:__
* Added `src/dist/ui.es5.js` full backwards compatible build for ES5 applications
* Added new `ApplicationAlert` component for displaying important server-wide notice banners on applications
